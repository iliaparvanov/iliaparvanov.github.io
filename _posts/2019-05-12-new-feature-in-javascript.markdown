In this article, I will lay out how I made a fast static website with a blog and hosted it for free.

I must first point out that this website is entirely static which makes it a breeze to host. Currently, it is hosted for free on [Github Pages][github-pages]. Despite that, it has all the functionality you'd expect from a full-fledged Wordpress blog: analytics, personalized recommendations, easy and hassle-free editing and uploading of posts.

This blog post will soon be continued.
